I'm a student at NAU in my fourth year of enrollment. I'm currently majoring in applied computer science and minoring in studio art,
exploring options in museum studies. I spend my time playing video games, gardening, and occasionally creating digital and traditional art.
I'm a fan of most game genres, but specifically I'm interested in farming games, rpgs, and action games.
